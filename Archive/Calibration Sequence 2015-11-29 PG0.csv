0,1,500,1,0,,"count is simple counter to know where you are in each stage - once app sees zero again (next stage), it holds last values until previous stage is complete. A negative count number will loop back -X rows."
1,1,500,1,0,,"Good to initially start pump high to overcome any stall issues, then throttle back."
2,1,400,1,0,,Stage 1 = checking humidity and temperature
